# Sketch Commands

Sketch Commands is a port of some of my [Orange Commands for Fireworks](https://github.com/bomberstudios/fireworks) for Bohemian Coding’s [Sketch.app](http://sketchapp.com).

## Installation

1. [Download the ZIP file with the commands](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-commands/zipball/master)
2. Unzip
3. Double click the .sketchplugin file to install

## More info

If you are curious about scripting Sketch, here's a link to the official [Sketch Scripting API documentation](http://developer.sketchapp.com).


## Thanks

- Huge props to Bohemian Coding (and specially Pieter Omvlee) for their collaboration on making the scripting API a reality.
- Hugs to [@guerrero](https://github.com/guerrero) for updating the project to the new bundle format for Plugins in Sketch.
