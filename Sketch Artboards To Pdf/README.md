# Artboards to PDF

A Sketch plugin to export artboards to PDF slideshow.

There are three option for exporting:

- Export the artboards in the current page.
- Export all artboards in the document.
- Export only the currently selected artboards.

The PDF slideshow page order is determined by the artboard export setting in Sketch's preferences. 

Thanks to [exevil](https://github.com/exevil) for adding functionality to export selected artboards.
